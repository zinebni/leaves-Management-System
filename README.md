# 🚀 RHPlus

## 🧩 Why RHPlus?
There are many HR solutions available, but most have some key limitations:
- 🌍 They are universal platforms, not adapted to the local context in Morocco.
- ⚙️ They are often complex to use, requiring time and experience to learn.
- 💰 They are usually expensive, which is understandable for global platforms, but not aligned with local budgets.

## ✅ Our Solution: RHPlus
To address these limitations, we created RHPlus — an HR solution designed specifically for Morocco.
- 🇲🇦 Locally adapted: built with the Moroccan context in mind.
- 🎯 User-friendly: we focused on UX to ensure simplicity and ease of use.
- 💵 Affordable: priced appropriately for the Moroccan market.

At the moment, the core functionality of our platform is leave management. However, RHPlus is scalable, and we plan to add more features in the future.
